    <h2>What type of data PhishDetect collects</h2>
 
    <p>Firstly it is important to note that when you request a link or a page to be scanned for potential phishing you    might share some private information with this node, if such page or link contains any. However, you are given the agency to  decide which links and pages to scan and which not to. <b>No action is performed without your expressed manual consent.</b></ p>
 
    
    <h2>If you are using the default phishdetect.io node</h2>
 
    
    <p>We store details of links and pages that are detected to be suspicious, and we might use it to complement other    defensive services such as <a href="https://securitywithoutborders.org/tools/blockade.html">Blockade</a>, by adding to its    blocklist domains that are discovered serving phishing. These details are not shared with any third party and they are        exclusively stored on a server in the Netherlands, provided by <a href="https://greenhost.net">Greenhost</a>. We do not       store any information on scanned links and pages that were found to be innocuous.</p>
 
    
    <h2>If you are using an independent PhishDetect node</h2>
 
    
    <p>If you have configured your PhishDetect Extension to communicate with a different PhishDetect node than the        default, you should refer to its operators and their specific privacy policy.</p>
